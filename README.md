# The *.docm file(s) in this folder are Word template files.  In order to take full advantage of these templates, do the following:

1.  Open the file in Word;
2.  Save the file in Word as a "Macro-enabled Word Template" to your local drive.  This is usually the default file save location when you select "Macro-enabled Word Template" as the file type.  Save it with a template name that will make sense to you!
3.  Close the original template file.
4.  In Word, click File -> New.  (This is where different Word versions come into play.  If you see a "Local" folder, choose that.  If not, look for the template file with the name you set in step 2 above.
5.  The file that gets created will be a brand new file.
